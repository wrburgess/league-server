## Nuances/Rules Differences
* 280 NCAA Division I teams
* College players must fulfill 3 years or turn 21 before leaving for pros
* The designated hitter rule is used. In addition, a player may serve as both pitcher and DH at the same time and may remain in one position when removed in the other.
* One or both ends of a doubleheader are sometimes seven innings in length. 
* The NCAA has recently tightened the interpretation of what constitutes a regulation game, encouraging schools to play as many nine-inning games as possible. 
* A mercy rule may be in use, which terminates play when one team is ahead by 10 or more runs after seven innings (6Â½ innings if the home team is winning). In games that are scheduled for seven innings the rule takes effect in the fifth.
